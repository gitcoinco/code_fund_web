Pastebin Proxy is my website for, well, hence the name, Pastebin Proxy. I built it to bypass the Pastebin blocks. It’s blocked in Turkey at the moment. There were no other websites like that, and I was bored, so I built it. It’s now being used by many people in Turkey and other countries.
I saw CodeFund on a friend’s blog. I had no ads on my website because users didn’t like it, and I didn’t like it. But CodeFund was different, because it was not tracking the users, and it had “nice ads.” No pop-ups, false ads or stuff like that. So I decided to apply, and my website got approved.
I was checking my daily CodeFund revenue sometimes, and I decided it would be easier to build an app for that. First, I created a widget to use on my computer. Widgets aren’t so cool anymore, I was bored, I had lots of NodeMCU and OLED screens laying around, so I built it, and I thought it looked very cool! Then, I posted it on Twitter tagging CodeFund, and here we are.
